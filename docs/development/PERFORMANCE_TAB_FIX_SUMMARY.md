# Performance Tab Table Layout Fix Summary

## Problem Identified
The Performance tab in the Holdings table had a layout issue where colored performance metric boxes were stacking vertically instead of displaying properly in their designated table columns.

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Mismatched Column Count**: The CSS column width rules were designed for the Basic tab (9 columns) but the Performance tab has 10 columns
2. **Missing Performance Tab Specificity**: No specific CSS rules for the Performance tab table layout
3. **Box Model Issues**: Performance metric styling was causing overflow and stacking issues
4. **Insufficient Table Constraints**: No minimum width specified for the Performance tab's wider layout

## Changes Made

### 1. CSS File Updates (`EnhancedInvestmentsTable.css`)

#### Added Performance Tab Column Widths
- Added specific column width rules for the 10-column Performance tab layout:
  - Name: 18% (wider to accommodate investment names)
  - Target IRR: 9%
  - Actual IRR: 9%
  - Performance: 12% (wider for performance badges)
  - TVPI: 8%
  - DPI: 8%
  - RVPI: 8%
  - Current NAV: 10%
  - Total Called: 9%
  - Total Distributions: 9%

#### Enhanced Table Constraints
- Set minimum table width to 1200px for Performance tab (increased from 900px)
- Added specific cell constraints for Performance tab to prevent overflow

#### Optimized Performance Metric Styling
- Reduced padding on `.performance-metric` elements (from 10px 14px to 8px 10px)
- Added `display: inline-block` and `min-width: 80px` for consistent sizing
- Set `overflow: visible` and `white-space: nowrap` to prevent text wrapping issues

#### Improved Performance Badge Layout
- Reduced padding on `.performance-badge` elements (from 10px 16px to 6px 12px)
- Added `max-width: 100%` and proper overflow handling
- Maintained text readability while ensuring column containment

### 2. React Component Updates (`EnhancedInvestmentsTable.tsx`)

#### Added Performance Tab CSS Class
- Modified `renderPerformanceTab()` to add `performance-tab` class to the table element
- This enables the specific CSS rules for Performance tab column widths

## Expected Results

1. **Proper Column Alignment**: Performance metrics display in their designated table columns
2. **No Vertical Stacking**: Colored boxes remain horizontally aligned within table cells
3. **Maintained Visual Appeal**: Performance indicators retain their color-coded styling
4. **Responsive Layout**: Table scrolls horizontally when needed due to 1200px minimum width
5. **Consistent Spacing**: All table elements maintain proper spacing and alignment

## Files Modified

1. `/home/will/Tmux-Orchestrator/private-markets-tracker/frontend/src/components/EnhancedInvestmentsTable.tsx`
   - Line 472: Added `performance-tab` class to table element

2. `/home/will/Tmux-Orchestrator/private-markets-tracker/frontend/src/components/EnhancedInvestmentsTable.css`
   - Lines 350-389: Added Performance tab column widths and constraints
   - Lines 606-623: Optimized performance metric styling
   - Lines 674-693: Improved performance badge layout
   - Lines 351-352: Added minimum width for Performance tab

## Testing

Created test file: `test-performance-table-layout.html` to verify the fix works correctly with sample data showing:
- Proper 10-column layout
- Colored performance metrics in designated columns
- No vertical stacking issues
- Maintained visual styling

## Technical Notes

- Uses CSS `table-layout: fixed` for consistent column sizing
- Performance tab requires horizontal scrolling on smaller screens due to 10 columns
- Color-coded performance indicators (green=outperform, red=underperform, yellow=on-track) maintain functionality
- All changes are backward compatible with existing table tabs

## Impact

- ✅ Fixes Performance tab layout issues
- ✅ Maintains existing functionality for other tabs
- ✅ Preserves luxury design aesthetic
- ✅ Ensures proper data presentation for performance metrics
- ✅ No breaking changes to existing codebase
