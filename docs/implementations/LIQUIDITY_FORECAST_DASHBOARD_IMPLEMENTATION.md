## 🚀 Key Features Delivered

### ✅ **Forecast Override System**
**Problem Solved**: Need to incorporate known/confirmed cash flows while preserving original pacing model assumptions

**Solution**: **ForecastAdjustment** system that allows targeted overrides without complicating base models
- Override specific dates with confirmed capital calls or distributions
- Maintain original vintage year, return expectations, and exit timeline for comparison
- Track reason and confidence level for each override
- Soft delete capability to maintain audit trail

**Example Use Cases**:
- GP confirms capital call of $500K on specific date → Override projected timing
- Early exit opportunity identified → Override distribution projections  
- Fund extension announced → Adjust distribution timing
- Emergency capital call → Override normal pacing schedule

### ✅ **12-Month Rolling Forecast**
**Advanced liquidity forecasting that combines**:
- **Existing pacing model projections** (J-curve, call schedules, distribution timing)
- **Known/confirmed cash flows** (via override system)
- **Portfolio-level aggregation** across all active investments
- **Monthly granularity** with precise liquidity gap identification

### ✅ **Liquidity Risk Management**
**Comprehensive risk analytics**:
- **Liquidity Gap Analysis**: Month-by-month identification of cash shortfalls
- **Stress Testing**: Accelerated calls and delayed distributions scenarios
- **Alert System**: Configurable warnings for liquidity shortfalls
- **Cash Flow Matching**: Identify opportunities to align distributions with capital calls

### ✅ **Professional Dashboard Interface**
**Enterprise-grade visualization**:
- **Interactive Charts**: Combined bar/line charts showing cash flows and cumulative positions
- **Monthly Breakdown Table**: Detailed period-by-period analysis
- **Override Management**: In-line ability to add known cash flow events
- **Alert System**: Visual warnings for liquidity risks
- **Stress Scenarios**: Bull/bear case analysis

## 📊 System Architecture

### **Data Flow**
```
Existing Pacing Model → Monthly Projections → Override Integration → Dashboard Visualization
     ↓                       ↓                      ↓                      ↓
J-curve forecasts      Monthly pro-ration    Known cash flows    Interactive charts
Call schedules         Period calculations   GP confirmations    Risk alerts
Distribution timing    Portfolio aggregation Early exits        Stress scenarios
```

### **Override Integration Logic**
1. **Generate base projections** from existing pacing model
2. **Check for active overrides** for each monthly period  
3. **Apply overrides** where they exist (takes precedence)
4. **Preserve original assumptions** for comparison and rollback
5. **Calculate portfolio totals** and risk metrics

### **Risk Management Features**
- **Liquidity Gap Alerts**: Configurable cash buffer thresholds
- **Large Capital Call Warnings**: Early warning for significant outflows
- **Cumulative Exposure Tracking**: Maximum portfolio exposure monitoring
- **Stress Testing**: Model accelerated calls and delayed distributions
