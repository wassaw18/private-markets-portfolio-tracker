```python
@dataclass
class DailyCashFlow:
    """Single day cash flow summary with transaction details"""
    date: date
    total_inflows: float = 0.0
    total_outflows: float = 0.0
    net_flow: float = 0.0
    transaction_count: int = 0
    transactions: List[Dict] = None

@dataclass
class PeriodSummary:
    """Period aggregation with comparative analytics"""
    total_inflows: float
    total_outflows: float
    net_flow: float
